# Chess-Simulator

In order to run SFML on vscode, I used [andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate](https://github.com/andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate) to help run the program.

To get this sfml-vscode-boilerplate to work I followed this [tutorial](https://game-developers.org/sfml-easy-setup-with-vs-code-c-tutorial/)

For the Chess-Simulator, I followed the guidelines from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4EuZI8Q8cs)
