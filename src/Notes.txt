Movement and Deletion

How each move is stored is through a string concatination.
One move is a string length of 5 "e3e4 ". NOTE: There is a space after the moveset.


Future Implementations:
	- Castling
	- Restrictions on moved pieces that aren't allowed to move a certain way
	- Maybe Change the size of the board
	- Board Flips when its the other players turn?


Bugs:
	- Getting the computer to move based on stockfish is not working
	- When I press "SpaceBar" the Space key is inputted 5 times, idkw
	- If you click on a piece it will say that you moved it,
	  I need to make sure that until the piece moves then
	  it saves the value.
